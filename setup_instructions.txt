The following needs to be done before starting the web server (this should be automated with a script):

0. The following programs need to be installed:
    - python3
    - nc (netcat)

1. Make an unpriviliged dummy user, which will be used to initiate reverse SSH connections to the probes.
    - adduser dummy

2. Generate an SSH key pair for the user
    - login dummy
    - ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
      (no key password)

3. Make sure root owns 'get_probe_keys.sh' & the script is executable
    - chown root get_probe_keys.sh
    - chmod +x get_probe_keys.sh

4. Move get_probe_keys.sh to /usr/bin

5. Add the following line to the end of /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
Match User dummy
    ForceCommand /bin/false
    AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/bin/get_probe_keys.sh
    AuthorizedKeysCommandUser nobody

6. Make a file with the path to the sqlite database (the get_probe_keys script will need to access this file)
    (will need to be root)
    - mkdir /etc/wifi_probing
    - add '/abs/path/to/database.db' to the file /etc/wifi_probing/db_path.txt
